    "Hong Kong is a major Asian destination for tourists. On average, more than 60 million tourists visit Hong Kong every year. When tourists visit Hong Kong, the most commonly used public transportation is MTR (Mass Transit Railway). The MTR system in Hong Kong currently has 95 heavy rail stations as of March 2020, and the daily ridership is around five million.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I would like to provide some guidance to tourists who are not very familiar with Hong Kong but may plan to visit it. As tourists are likely to make use of the MTR system to move around when they are in Hong Kong, I use MTR stations to represent different areas in town. I segment MTR station areas and explore the top venue categories in each area in Hong Kong. The segmentation analysis will be interpreted together with the population density of different districts in Hong Kong. Such information is helpful for tourists to plan their trip in Hong Kong."

In addition, if a station used a different name in the past, the table will show the current and the old station names in the same cell. Therefore, I will clean the table scraped from Wikipedia to make sure that it only shows the 95 current heavy rail stations of the MTR system in Hong Kong."
